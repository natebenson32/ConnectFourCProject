//Description: This source file has two functions that are
//supported by file_utils.h.
//save_board takes in a pointer for filename and a double pointer for a buffer. It then reads the file in in read mode, checks to see if the file isnt null, then reads its contents and counts a size, inputting the contents into a buffer, then closing the file.
